## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of Azure AI's Text Analytics service to analyze text files for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The code snippet provided allows for the processing of hotel reviews to extract valuable insights such as the language of the review, sentiment, key phrases, and named entities. By leveraging Azure's powerful AI capabilities, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of customer feedback and improve their services accordingly.

## Use Cases

1. **Language Detection**:

   - **Use Case**: Determine the language of each hotel review to support multilingual analysis and processing. This is useful for travel agencies operating globally, as it helps categorize and understand reviews in different languages.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:

   - **Use Case**: Analyze the sentiment of each review to gauge customer satisfaction. This helps the travel agency identify positive, neutral, or negative feedback, enabling them to address issues and improve services.

3. **Key Phrase Extraction**:

   - **Use Case**: Extract key phrases from reviews to identify the main topics and themes mentioned by customers. This provides insights into what aspects of the hotel (e.g., location, service, cleanliness) are most frequently discussed and valued by guests.

4. **Entity Recognition**:

   - **Use Case**: Identify and categorize named entities (e.g., locations, people, organizations) mentioned in the reviews. This helps the agency understand specific references to landmarks, staff members, or other notable features.

5. **Linked Entity Recognition**:
   - **Use Case**: Recognize entities and link them to external data sources (e.g., Wikipedia). This enhances the understanding of references made in the reviews and provides additional context. For example, linking "Buckingham Palace" to its Wikipedia page can provide more information about this landmark.

By implementing these use cases, businesses can automate the analysis of large volumes of customer reviews, extract actionable insights, and ultimately deliver better services and experiences to their customers.
