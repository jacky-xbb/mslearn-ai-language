## Introduction

The project demonstrates how to use Azure AI Language's question answering capability to create a simple interactive FAQ system.

## Configuration

```bash
export AI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT='https://<your-qna>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/'
```

## Use Cases

1. **Interactive FAQ System**:

   - **Use Case**: Create an interactive FAQ system that allows users to ask questions in natural language and receive answers from a predefined knowledge base. This can be integrated into websites or applications to provide instant support and information to users.

2. **Customer Support Automation**:

   - **Use Case**: Automate customer support by enabling a chatbot to answer common questions using a knowledge base. This reduces the workload on human support agents and provides users with immediate answers to their queries.

3. **Knowledge Base Querying**:

   - **Use Case**: Enable users to query a large knowledge base of question and answer pairs using natural language input. This makes it easier for users to find specific information without manually searching through extensive documents.

4. **Personal Assistant Integration**:

   - **Use Case**: Integrate the question answering capability into personal assistant applications to provide users with answers to frequently asked questions, improving the user experience by offering quick and relevant responses.

5. **Internal Documentation Support**:
   - **Use Case**: Support employees within an organization by providing a tool to query internal documentation and knowledge bases. This can help employees find information more efficiently, enhancing productivity and reducing the time spent searching for answers.

### Example Scenarios
